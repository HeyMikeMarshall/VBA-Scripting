VBA Scripting homework, week 2

Greetings,

Just a few notes about my script here.

First off, it's fully complete, Hard version plus Challenge.
I should note that I did run into some issues relating to poor optimization on my part. Basically, the script wanted to take over 20 hours to complete. However, I was able to find what was slowing the script down so badly, and it does not complete the full data set in approximately 20 mintues on my laptop.

In attempting to troubleshoot the bottleneck I ended up adding times and an application status bar indicator that calculates the percentage of completion on each sheet, as well as a counter to identify how many individual stock tickers that the script has compiled. At the end of the script, a MsgBox is generated that shows that the script has completed, and indicates how many rows of data were compiled in total, as well as how long the script took to successfully complete.

Screenshots and script can be found here.

Thank you, and happy grading!
