VBA Scripting homework, week 2

Greetings,

Just a few notes about my script here.

First off, it's fully complete, Hard version plus Challenge.
I should note that I did run into some bottlenecking because I wrote a very badly optimized first version. Basically, the script wanted to take over 20 hours to complete. Don't worry, I did fix the bottleneck, so it should only take about 20 minutes now to complete.

In troubleshooting the bottleneck I ended up adding some processing indicators to the application status bar as well as a message box to report success, with the elapsed time and total number of rows compiled. I left those features in, so you will see those implemented in the script I've submitted.

Screenshots and a copy of the script are right here.

Thank you, and happy grading!
